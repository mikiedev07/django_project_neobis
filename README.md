# Blog Post

Provides the ability to create posts on any topic

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project You need Python 3+ version to be installed on your computer. 
To check your Python Version on Windows in console:
```
python -V
```

### Installing

Also, you need to install some python libraries like Django, Rest Framework etc.
You can install it by using requirements file in root directory by command (on Windows):

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

To check if you did install correctly, get to root directory (with manage.py file) and type in console:

```
python manage.py runsever
```

This will run local server, and you will see main page of web-application with existing posts.

## Short usage guide

You are given the opportunity to register or log in to the site if you already have an account by clicking on the appropriate Login/Register links in the top menu.

On the main page, you can see existing posts by other authors (and yours, if available). If you click on the author's nickname, the selection will be only from the posts that this author created. You cannot create posts until you log in.

By clicking on the title of the post, you will go to its detailed part. Here you can see the full content of the post, the attached image and comments. To leave comments, you need to be an authorized user.

To view all existing posts, you can use pagination.

Links are also available to view the most recent posts (created within the last week). Also announcements.
